# KeyVox

**KeyVox** is a local-first macOS dictation app. Hold a trigger key to record, release to transcribe with Whisper on-device, and insert text into the active app.

## Why KeyVox

KeyVox is built for low-latency, local transcription with deep macOS integration.

- Local Whisper inference (no cloud transcription path)
- Global modifier-key trigger workflow
- Accessibility-first text insertion with fallback behavior
- Menu bar-first UX with onboarding and settings

## Features

### Performance & AI
- **Local Whisper pipeline**: Uses `whisper.cpp` through the local `KeyVoxWhisper` package.
- **Model artifact**: Uses `ggml-base.bin` (plus CoreML encoder assets when available).
- **Automatic language detection**: Transcription runs with Whisper language `.auto`.
- **Model pre-warming**: Loads model early to reduce first-transcription delay.

### Interaction
- **Configurable trigger binding**: Left/Right Option, Command, Control, or Fn.
- **Default trigger**: **Right Option (⌥)**.
- **Hands-free mode**: Hold **Shift** while releasing trigger to keep recording until trigger is pressed again.
- **Escape to cancel**: Press **Esc** during recording/transcribing to abort.

### Injection & Feedback
- **Accessibility-first insertion**: Attempts direct insertion in focused controls.
- **Fallback insertion**: Uses menu-bar Paste automation when direct insertion is unavailable.
- **Overlay feedback**: Floating recording/transcribing overlay with persisted position.
- **Audio cues**: Start/stop/cancel sounds (when enabled).

### App Operations
- **Onboarding flow**: Microphone, Accessibility, and model setup on first launch.
- **Update checks**: Manual and timer-based checks backed by GitHub Releases metadata via `Core/Services/AppUpdateService.swift`.
- **Warnings**: In-app warning overlays for missing model or permissions.

## Architecture

KeyVox is organized by responsibility:

- **`App/KeyVoxApp.swift`**: app entry point, menu bar scene, window lifecycle.
- **`Core/TranscriptionManager.swift`**: central recording/transcription state machine.
- **`Core/AudioRecorder.swift`**: 16kHz mono audio capture pipeline.
- **`Core/KeyboardMonitor.swift`**: global/local modifier and escape monitoring.
- **`Core/OverlayManager.swift`**: overlay lifecycle, drag persistence, display reconnection behavior.
- **`Core/Services/WhisperService.swift`**: model loading and local transcription.
- **`Core/Services/PasteService.swift`**: text insertion + fallback strategy.
- **`Core/Services/AppUpdateService.swift`**: GitHub Releases polling and update prompt triggers.
- **`Views/RecordingOverlay.swift` + `Views/Components/KeyVoxLogo.swift`**: branded visual identity layer.

### KeyVoxWhisper Wrapper
`Packages/KeyVoxWhisper` is the project-local Swift wrapper around official `whisper.cpp` binaries. It isolates upstream compatibility churn behind a stable Swift interface used by app code.

## Repository Structure

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **macOS 15.6 or later**
- Apple Silicon recommended for best performance (Intel supported)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/macmixing/keyvox.git`
2. Open `KeyVox.xcodeproj` in Xcode.
3. Build and run.
4. Complete onboarding to grant permissions and download model assets.

## Usage

1. **Configure**: Pick your trigger key in Settings (Default: **Right Option (⌥)**).
2. **Standard dictation**: Hold trigger -> speak -> release to transcribe and insert.
3. **Hands-free**: Hold trigger -> hold **Shift** -> release trigger -> press trigger again to stop.
4. **Cancel**: Press **Esc** to abort the active session.

## Troubleshooting

- **Model missing**: Open Settings and download/retry model setup.
- **No text insertion**: Verify Accessibility permission in System Settings.
- **No input audio**: Verify microphone permission and selected microphone in Settings.
